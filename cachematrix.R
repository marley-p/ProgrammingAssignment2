## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function takes a matrix as input and creates a list containing
# four functions that:
#set the value of the matrix
#get the value of the matrix
#set the value of the matrix inverse
#get the value of the matrix inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inv) m <<- inv
  getinv <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## his function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
#makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
#matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(m)
  m
}
